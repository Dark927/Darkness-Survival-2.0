### Story - Intro

The skies on this world somehow reminded Nero of his own homeworld. Same deep blue sky, and same white clouds wandering through its plain. He exhaled loudly, looking up in the skies, then looked down on his ship, which was standing in the middle of a forest clearing.

\-No time to rest. – He said for himself. – I should obtain an artifact before the night falls.

He checked all his equipment and looked down on the PDA, which showed a map of surrounding area. He saw a village nearby. It was the village, where the artifact was seen, judging by the reports.

Slowly walking through the forest, he soon found it. Small, very old-looking and with very little people.

\-Fine. It will be easy. I don’t think locals will put up a fight, unlike the previous ones. Those ones, who had guns…

Few people showed up from their houses, as Nero approached a village. They weren’t looking too friendly, some of them were covered in blood, some had a jewelry, made of someone’s flesh. One man approached Nero in the village. Despite of his bloody looks, he was very pleasant to speak:

\-Welcome, stranger! What brings you to us? We welcome our friends, and we kill our enemies. So, which one are you?

\-Greetings, old man. I've heard stories about your lands, particularly about a powerful artifact that grants power to those who appreciate it. To be honest, sir, I was fascinated by these stories, and I would be extremely happy just to have the chance to see it and feel even a fraction of its power.

\-Oh, I see, young one… Our village appreciates the artifact, indeed… But to feel its power, you must prove you are worthy of it… Join us on our night ritual, young one… We will see what truly drives you. Until then, you may stay in my home.

\-Thank you! I am worthy, you will see!

\-Hehe… We will, kid, we will…

Having his little performance finished for the locals, Nero gave a slight half-bow toward the old man. The elder smiled in return, accepting the gesture of respect. Now, only one thing remained—to take the artifact during the ritual, whatever it might be, and simply use the Mark of Return to escape instantly to the ship, and then off this world.

The old man's house was surprisingly decent. Definitely better than Nero had expected after seeing the locals. Though old and wooden, it at least had some decent furniture inside. But the decorations… those were in the locals' style. Crosses made from severed arms, skulls mounted on the walls, and writings scrawled in blood.

As the two suns of this world dipped below the horizon, he heard the village come to life. Shouts, conversations, and the clatter of tools filled the air. At that moment, a figure appeared in the doorway—it was the old man.

\-The time has come, stranger. Come with me.

Nero stepped outside, accompanied by the old man. As they walked through the village, bonfires ignited one by one, and more and more people joined the elder. They were all dressed in white robes with red patterns. Young women in flowing white dresses twirled around the fires, flashing Nero predatory smiles as they danced.

After a few minutes, the old man led Nero to a massive stone jutting out of the ground like a giant fang. The very tip of this "fang" pulsed with a bright crimson glow, and bonfires burned around it, casting flickering shadows. The scene was both mesmerizing and deeply unsettling—a perfect place for a ritual.

The locals sat around the bonfires, their eyes fixed on Nero and the old man, who began his speech:

— Tonight, a new soul wishes to become one with the Stone! Tonight, he shall prove whether he is worthy of the power he seeks! Tonight, he shall spill his blood and taste ours! Tonight, he shall discover who he truly is!

The crowd erupted in approving shouts, their voices rising in unison to support the elder. Somewhere among them, the steady rhythm of drums began to echo through the night.

The elder stepped closer to Nero and drew a knife. Nero tensed but decided to play along with the locals—for now. After all, the artifact was at stake.

The elder took Nero’s left hand and, with a swift motion, sliced a deep cut across his palm. Nero clenched his teeth, stifling a pained gasp. Without hesitation, the old man grabbed his other hand and did the same, leaving matching wounds. Then he leaned in, his voice low and firm:

— Now, step up to the Stone, young one, and grasp it with both hands. No matter how much it hurts—do not let go!

Nero slowly approached the Stone. Its glow intensified with every step he took, and the moment his bloodied hands touched the artifact, it felt as if it leaped into his grasp on its own.

A searing pain ripped through his entire body, as if he had been impaled on a massive, unyielding metal spike. His first instinct was to let go of the cursed artifact, but the elder’s words echoed in his mind. Clenching his teeth, he endured the agony.

The time has come! Nero thought, mentally activating the Mark of Return.

The pain surged even stronger as a blinding flash of light—always a part of teleportation—exploded before his eyes. A familiar sensation of weightlessness took hold of him. But this time… something was wrong. The feeling didn’t fade. There was only darkness. And silence.

Then, suddenly, the fall ended—Nero crashed hard against solid ground. The cool night air was gone. The shouts of the villagers and the crackling of bonfires had vanished.

All that remained was the stale scent of old, damp air—like in an abandoned cellar—and an eerie, oppressive silence.

The artifact was no longer in his hands. Yet, strangely, he could still feel it, as if it hovered nearby, unseen but present.

— Where the hell did I end up…? — Nero muttered through clenched teeth, still aching from the pain.


A towering, muscular figure loomed over Nero as he stepped into what had seemed like a small cave. The creature’s skin was the same hue as the stone around it, and its voice rumbled like a mountain rockslide.

"Who are you?!" it boomed, shaking the entire cave. "Which of this world's wretched creatures dares disturb me?"

Nero cautiously peeked out from behind a boulder where he had managed to take cover, stealing a glance at the cave’s master. This being was clearly not human—standing well over three meters tall, with a massive, muscular frame that promised trouble for any opponent. He wore only a simple loincloth, his thick, gray beard resting on his broad chest, parts of it singed by fire. A wild mane of the same gray hair cascaded over his shoulders, and his eyes burned with an inner fire, radiating both power and authority.

"I come in peace!" Nero called out, still peering cautiously from behind the rock.

"You are… sentient?!" A hint of surprise flickered in the giant’s voice. "You can speak?"

"Yes… I’m here! I mean no harm!" Nero stepped out from behind the boulder, raising his hands to show he was unarmed. The god’s gaze locked onto him, making Nero feel deeply uneasy. This was a presence unlike any he had encountered before—one that exuded the might and majesty of a higher being.

"How did you end up here, traveler? And what is your name?" The giant shifted his weight onto one leg, lifting a hand in a questioning gesture.

"I’m Nero! I arrived here after trying to use a Recall Mark while holding a strange artifact… I still don’t fully understand where I am, but I haven’t had a moment of rest since I got here."

The explanation seemed to satisfy the giant, as his expression shifted to something calmer, more contemplative.

"Then you have found one of my creations…"

"Your creations?"

"Yes, mortal… The world you have stumbled into by accident is a prison. A prison forged from the remnants of other worlds, meant to contain me—Enor, god of all blacksmiths and craftsmen! The power of my creations frightened the other gods so much that they betrayed me, sealing me within this place… And I swore that once I escape, I will have my vengeance!"

"If this prison was designed to hold an actual god, then I doubt I stand any chance of escaping..."

"I fear, mortal, that your chances truly are slim. The greatest danger here is time. The longer you remain trapped in the endless cycle of death and rebirth, the more this place takes from you—first your mind, then your soul, and finally even your body… You are not the first sentient being to find yourself here by accident… Though the last one I spoke to was, I believe, a few centuries ago…"

"That’s… reassuring."

"I believe that together, we have a chance to break our chains." Enor’s burning gaze locked onto Nero with newfound intensity. "You see, mortal, this world has restrictions that I cannot overcome. The first of my bindings prevents me from leaving this cave. The second forbids me from approaching the Anchor Stones… There may be others, but until these are broken, I cannot know for certain. But you, mortal… You are free within the confines of this world… You could help me!"

"And what exactly would I have to do?"

"First, you need proper equipment… You won’t get far with that sword of yours. And I am a blacksmith! I can forge weapons and armor fit for the greatest warrior! But since this cave is my cage, I cannot gather the materials I need… And those materials are rather… specific."

"What do you mean?"

"You will need to collect Soul Shards from the enemies you defeat. With them, I can forge weapons and armor that will help you survive in this world—and destroy the Anchor Stones!"

"Destroy the Anchor Stones?"

"Yes, mortal. They activate at night, glowing with bright red runes and symbols across their surfaces. Slay the stone’s guardians, then destroy the stone itself. If all the anchors are broken, my chains will fall…"
